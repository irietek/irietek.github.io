      <h3>Irietek Products</h3>
      <p>Irietek focuses on the development of software that will afford businesses valuable 
      tools to compete in an increasingly technical market. Our tools aim to automate tasks 
      and provide services with minimal effort or cost to our customers. Most notable are the 
      projects code-named "La Kaye" and "Fish Tea" respectively. More information on these two 
      products can be found in the menu to the left.</p>
      <p>We are working on several other products to fill customer service, marketing and analysis 
      requirements for small businesses. In the coming weeks, we will be unveiling some of these 
      products. So we ask that you check back often or sign up on our product update list to be 
      alerted when new products are released.</p>
      <p>In addition to these products, we sponsor several Community Projects that are open to 
      developers and end-users who apply. As supporters of the Open Source movement, we introduce 
      these projects as a way to illustrate the benefits of community based collaboration. For 
      more information about these projects, feel free to contact us via 
      <a href="mailto:products@irietek.com">email</a></p>
