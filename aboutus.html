      <h3>Irietek at a glance</h3>
      <p>The Irietek Corporation, a leader in the developing software solutions for small 
      businesses, had its humble beginnings in the Caribbean. As our name alludes to, we aim to 
      bring a harmonious balance to business with technology. And although we have only just 
      recently incorporated in the United States, Irietek has been operating as a Caribbean 
      technology firm for several years now, providing small businesses with an easy and affordable 
      step in the door to cyberspace. Our team is made up of a group of talented individuals 
      covering several countries and areas of expertise, joined by a unified dedication to leveling 
      the "digital divide" that exists for many businesses.</p>
